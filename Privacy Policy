_Last updated: 2025-11-25_

## 1. Introduction
The Big Johnson ("the Bot") is an automated moderation bot designed for Discord servers.  
This privacy policy explains what data the Bot collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

By adding or using the Bot in a server, you agree to the data practices described in this policy.

## 2. Data Collected

### 2.1 Server Metadata
The Bot may store limited server information necessary for operation:
- Server ID  
- Channel IDs (for configuration)  
- Role IDs (if used in moderation rules)  
- User IDs of server administrators configuring the bot  

_No usernames, nicknames, or message content is stored unless explicitly stated below._

### 2.2 Message Content (Conditionally)
The Bot reads message content **only for moderation purposes**, such as:
- Detecting spam  
- Detecting banned words or phrases  
- Detecting links, attachments, or formatting that triggers rules  

**Message content is not permanently stored.**  
It is processed in real-time and discarded immediately after rule evaluation.

### 2.3 Moderation Logs (Optional)
If the server enables moderation logging, the Bot may temporarily store:
- User ID of the moderated user  
- Type of action taken (mute, warn, delete, timeout, ban)  
- Reason provided by moderators  
- Timestamp  

These logs may be stored either:
- **Locally on the server** (if using file-based logs), or  
- **In a database** controlled by the Bot owner (if configured).

### 2.4 Error & Diagnostic Data
For security and debugging, the Bot may collect:
- Internal error messages  
- Timestamps  
- Non-identifying technical information  

This data never includes message content.

## 3. How Data Is Used
Data is used only to:
- Enforce moderation rules  
- Provide bot functionality (warnings, timeouts, logging, etc.)  
- Improve reliability and performance  
- Prevent abuse or exploitation of the bot  

The Bot **does not** use data for advertising, analytics, or profiling.

---

## 4. Data Sharing
The Big Johnson does **not** sell, rent, or share data with third parties.  
Data may be disclosed **only** if:
- Required by law, or  
- Necessary to protect the security of the bot or its users  

---

## 5. Data Retention

### 5.1 Temporary Processing
- Message content is **not retained** after moderation checks.

### 5.2 Logs
- Moderation logs (if enabled) are stored until manually deleted by a server administrator or the bot owner.
- Diagnostic logs are kept for the minimum time necessary to troubleshoot issues.

## 6. Data Security
The Bot implements reasonable protections, including:
- Restricted database access  
- Encryption (when supported by hosting platform)  
- Permission-limited bot commands  

However, no system is 100% secure. Use the bot at your own discretion.

## 7. User Rights
Users may request:
- Deletion of moderation logs involving their user ID

Requests can be made to the Bot owner.
