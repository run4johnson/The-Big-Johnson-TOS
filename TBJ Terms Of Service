# Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Collected
Because The Big Johnson is an **automod bot**, it may process or store:
- **User IDs** (for moderation history or automod actions)  
- **Server settings** (banned words, roles, channels, log settings)

Data is used only for:

- Executing moderation actions (warnings, deletions, logs)  
- Storing server automod configuration  

## 3. Data Storage & Retention
- Message content is processed **only in memory** and not stored long-term.  
- User moderation logs (if the server enables them) may be saved.  
- Server automod settings are stored until the server removes the Bot or resets them.

## 4. Data Sharing
The Bot does *not* sell or share user data with third parties.  
Data may be shared only to comply with:
- Discord API requirements  
- Legal obligations (rare)
